//! Shadows cast on the ground by the volumetric cloud deck.
//!
//! # How this works
//!
//! Bevy's [`DirectionalLightTexture`] is a light cookie: a texture projected
//! along a directional light, multiplying its intensity per fragment. That is
//! exactly the shape of a cloud shadow, so no extra render pass is needed --
//! this module only has to keep the texture up to date.
//!
//! The projection happens in the light's own local frame, which means the
//! sun-parallel component of a world position is discarded before the lookup.
//! That discarding *is* the shadow projection: two points that differ by a step
//! along the sun direction sample the same texel, so a ground point samples
//! whatever the cloud deck is doing directly up-sun of it, with the long
//! stretching of low-angle shadows falling out for free.
//!
//! The texture itself is built on the CPU from [`CloudField`], the same field
//! the sky shader raymarches, so the shadows are the shadows of the clouds that
//! are actually up there and they travel with the same wind.
//!
//! # Costs and caveats
//!
//! Building the texture is the expensive part, so it is rebuilt a few times a
//! second and spread across frames a slice at a time; between rebuilds the wind
//! is carried by translating the light, which is free and continuous.
//!
//! Light cookies ride on Bevy's clustered decal machinery, which needs both the
//! `pbr_light_textures` feature and a GPU with texture binding arrays. Where
//! either is missing the texture is simply never sampled -- lighting is
//! completely normal, just unshadowed by cloud.
